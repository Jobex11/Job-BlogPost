* CONNECTING SANITY TO NEXTJS APPLICATION.
-> any time you made changes to the  next.config.js file 
always go back to spin up the server.

=> POST not properly working at 1:14:0
 =====  CREATING THE POST SECTION  =====

-> it ended with a bug: the  Post.body function isn't responding

 -> there is fault in post.body or  react portable text itself.
 =====  CREATING THE COMMENT SECTION   =======
 time: 1:15:16 
 we use the react hook form submission

 
======  CREATING NEXT AUTHENTICATION   ========

   ======  NPM INSTALLATION  ======
   * git clone https://github.com/noorjsdivs/testblog.git
   * npm i
   * npm -y create sanity@latest
   * npm install next-sanity 
   * npm install @portabletext/react @sanity/image-url 
 {from npm -> next-sanity}
   * npm i react-portable-text
   * npm install  react-hook-from 
   (to handle forms submission in our application)
   * npm i @sanity/client
   * npm install next-auth
   (because we are using google authenticaton we will need to create an 
   application on firebase.)
   (you don't need to install firebase but you only need to create an application)
   * sanity deploy (to create a url for sanity)

 =====  ERROR AND DEBUGGING ======
 * VITE CSS: is caused by sanity when we are using tailwind css in our 
nextjs tutorials and we are not using it inside our sanity folder 
-> copy and paste [tailwind.config.js] file into the sanity folder.
* import {createClient} from "next-sanity" not found on node module 
-> have to install  next-sanity using  
[npm install next-sanity]
